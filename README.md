# Biography

I am a student majoring Information Technology in International University - VNUHCM, pursuing Bachelor Degree of Engineering and even further, the Master Degree of Information Technology Management. 

I was mainly working on the backend, focusing on semantical design of critical system, ensuring correctness upon End-to-End Integration. Until Q4 of 2024, I started to delve into Front-End using Next.js, Tailwind and React to start making visually pleasing user interface.

I have good skill set in problem solving - gathered from my past experiences attending Olympiad level competitions, most of them are endorsed by reowned organizations like Ministry of Education and Training, or Ho Chi Minh Youth Union - and I believe that these skills will help me to land some job(s).
